# Advent of Code 2025
On this repository I'll update my codes for the Advent of Code 2025, made using Python.
## File structure
Some problems are uploaded as (day).py and (day)_p2.py for parts 1 and 2, respectively. For others, both parts are located in the same file 
(usually if the change from part 1 to part 2 is small enough that it doesn't need a big restructuration of the code)
## Code
All code is in Python, as it's faster to develop on. AI is not used for these problems, as it would defeat the purpose.
Although efficiency is important, I'll prioritize producing fast over producing quality code for this repository. The goal is not to get the
best solution, but to build a solution in the fastest time possible. That said, I'll try not to have the quality degenerate too much.
## Remarks
Code will be pushed at least the day after the challenge is over, to maintain the spirit of the challenge
